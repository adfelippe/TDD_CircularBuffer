### TDD Circular Buffer

This project is just a simple test file created to solve the exercise proposed in the James W. Grenning's Test-Driven Development for Embedded C about creating a Circular Buffer Driver unit test using TDD.

The only difference is that this test uses ceedling instead on plain unity framework.

Firstly install ceedling and the run `ceedling` to run all the tests.
Ceedling has plenty of documentation around, so be happy! :)
